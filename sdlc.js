// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step we will analyze and determine the requirments of the software and document them"
const design = "we will translate the requirements into a software solution and create a design. "
const implementation = "In this step we will write the code and implement the design and the requirements"
const testingandintegration =  "In this stage we will test the code and get it ready to be a final product by debugging preparing it to integrate in the existing or new system "
const Maintain = "Maintenance involves updating an existing software product to fix bugs and ensure reliability."
